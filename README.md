# AAE421_Project
Final project for AAE 421

In order to run 'blimp_simulation.slx' use the 'blimp_setup.m' file.  

This file allows you to input a simulation configuration such as (open vs closed loop), 
(controllers on/off) and operation mode ('hold altitude, track circle etc.)

The 'blimp_simulation.m' file will graph the system response vs the target response
and save the figues as .png to a figures/ folder.
